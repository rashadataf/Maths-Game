# Maths-Game
This game just for fun while you are testing your maths experience.
The game has been made by me from scratch using a mexture from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to play
The game started after you press on "Start" button.
a Counter will show up and start to count down from 60 to 0.
Random questions will appear and you have to choose the correct answer from multiple answers.
Each time you choose the correct answer your score will increase by 1.
If you choose the wrong answer nothing will happen just a message will pop up telling you "Try Again".
When the time is equal to 0 the game will end and "Game Over" modal will pop up.

## How to run the game
Just clone the project to your local computer and open **index.html**.
